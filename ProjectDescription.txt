I. General description:

II. Configuration of solution:

III. Existing problems:
1. Table size limitation
2. Integer size limitation
3. Boxing of structures
4. Double memory usage
5. Calculation starting after complete reading of spreadsheet
6. Reading much slower that calculation
7. Multi threading only slow down calculation for simple expressions 

IV. Ways to optimize solution:
1. Start calculation during reading
1. Expression cashing

V. Misc(strange part in the project):
1. Manual integer parsing instead  int.Parser
Reason of it is that int.Parse requires string for parsing which leads to redundant object creating
is done to read integer while reading stream char by char without string.

2. Creating of ExtendedLazy class although there are standard class Lazy.
